# Git Practice
A simple project to practice a few git/github workflows.  Replace the contents of this file with the contents indicated in the [instructions](./instructions.md).

[This article](https://github.com/software-students-fall2021/git-workflow-practice-jhk742.git) caught my attention because it's something contrary to what a lot of people are saying. This was especially the case when I was still in Korea and my brother had just recently got a new job, a job that is lucrative, but has the potential of being assigned to AI and having my brother go on the job hunt again. I don't know if what this article is fullproof in all that it claims, but it is reassuring and disheartening at the same time to learn that AI is not yet fully fledged to take over vocations that require more expertise.
